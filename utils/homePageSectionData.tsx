        title: `A forest is much more than a plantation`,
        description: `Historically, afforestation favored plantations of single species, as a means to generate
         income from timber and other products. Monoculture forests do have carbon benefits—204 million acres of new
         plantations could sequester 18.1 gigatons of CO2 over a 30-year period. But as they are grown as even-aged
         monocultures, intensively managed and harvested on relatively short rotations, there are concerns that
         plantations may negatively impact biodiversity. A stand of a single species does little to promote plant
         and animal diversity, is much less resilient to diseases and pests, and can even cause harm by overusing
         water or mineral resources in the soil, especially if the species in question is not native to or not
         prevalent in the area.`,

         Oaks are true guardians of the land, growing to majestic sizes and typically having long lives.
         They are also great “carbon sinks”, absorbing and trapping huge quantities of carbon in their wood fiber, 
         while also acting as protectors and food source to many other species in their vicinity, creating their 
         own mini-ecosystems around themselves. This is the ethos of Roburna.`,
